## Metting professionnals

Today we had the chance to meet to profesionnals to help us define the big issues of our project. The first met Jerôme Nika who is a researcher and a musician. 
And we then met Yvonne Förster who is a philosopher in the field phenomenology, technology and in particular AI. 

## Our Idea 

After much research, talking and thinking, we finally landed on a “precise” idea of what we want to do. Our main objective was to create a program that would collaborate with the user, something that would complement his work and not just help him achieve his goal. We wanted the final artworked to be co-signed, co-created. Thus we decided to do an application that will draw in the continuity of the user’s drawing. It will work like a kind of game : the user enters the app and choses a mask that will be applied on a canvas. On this canvas the user can then draw what he wants and once he’s satisfied he sends his work to the AI. It will then complete the drawing as it learned in the training phase and returns his part to the user. We then obtain a complete drawing with both the user and the AI lines.
