---

<p>Today we will actually be getting started on the project. We will have three intense weeks to works exclusively on this.</p>
<p>Our plan is : </p>
* Fisrt week : familiarize with the technologies we will be using : we chose to work with the Tensorflow API for Python. Then we will start to work on our Neural Network.
* Second week : we hope we will be able to start training our network and maybe have first results. Besides we will start to build the website to host the application.
* Thrid week : if we are in time we will use this week to experiment with our program and try to have satisfing results. And we will finish the website.
