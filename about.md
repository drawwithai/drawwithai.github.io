This is a supervised project of second year of IMAC engineering school (ESIPE - Gustave Eiffel University, Champs-sur-Marne, France) by Léa Rostoker, Esaïe Dago and Alaric Rougnon-Glasson, supervised by Gaétan de Robillard and Vincent Nozick.
Our goal is to create a web application that allows users to experiment drawing in collaboration with and artificial intelligence.

## Abstract

Over the last years, artists have presented a great interest in computer science and particularly in artificial intelligence. With this project, we want to provide artists with a new way to create. Our wish was to create a technology capable of interacting with the user, to cooperate with him instead of being a mere media to use. Thus, we chose to build a web application where anyone can draw and see what the program has to propose as it will draw in the continuity of the user’s creation.
